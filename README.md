# Deno Fresh Demo

This demo application is based on Deno and Fresh. Deno is a Javascript runtime, which is meant to be an improvement on NodeJS. Fresh is a new web framework built on Deno.

This demo displays a table called Visitors. Each row of the table displays a first name and a family name, followed by an edit button and a delete button.

Table data is saved in a Key/Value database, Denokv.

Tailwind, a CSS framework, is used for styling.
